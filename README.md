- 👋 Hi, I’m @The3DStore
- 👀 I’m interested in making 3D Printing as easy as clicking a button and watching your print be created in front of your very eyes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PWA and basic app development to help make 3D Printing accessible.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything 3D Printing related.
- 📫 How to reach me email: sam@the3dstore.co.uk
